This thesis investigates how various language modeling strategies can assist in automating this process by classifying publication abstracts for their relevance to PaxDb. Starting from a curated set of labeled examples, I developed and evaluated a diverse range of classification strategies, from classical vector space models established decades ago to deep neural architectures that now dominate the field of natural language processing.</p> <p>A central challenge addressed in this work is the small size and inherent class imbalance of the labeled dataset. To mitigate overfitting and improve generalization, I introduced a novel similarity-aware data-splitting strategy that leverages embedding-derived cosine similarity to guide stratified train/test partitioning. This allowed me to better control data leakage and assess model robustness under realistic conditions.</p> <p>My evaluation spans classical machine learning classifiers on low-dimensional embeddings, attention-based neural networks for full token representations, fine-tuned pre-trained transformer encoders, and custom transformer encoder architectures trained from scratch. Models were optimized for both precision-oriented and balanced objectives, revealing that precision can be maximized through careful model selection and targeted tuning. This thesis provides a comprehensive comparative analysis across embedding families and classification strategies, offers a reproducible optimization and evaluation framework, and lays the groundwork for integrating transformer-based models into PaxDb\u2019s curation pipeline.

Sequencing runs typically generate millions of reads in which the vast majority of the reads has an average error rate below 1/1000. However, some paired-end sequencing data show the presence of a subpopulation of reads where the second read (R2) has lower average qualities. We show that the fragment length is a major driver of increased error rates in the R2 reads.  Fragments above 500 nt tend to yield lower base qualities and higher error rates than shorter fragments. We use publicly available Illumina data to demonstrate that the fragment length dependency of the R2 read qualities exists in various library protocols, in different labs and using different sequencer models. Our finding extends the understanding of the Illumina read quality and has implications on error models for Illumina reads.

They exhibit diverse and intriguing patterns in a wide range of cancers and are closely associated with tumorigenesis. Currently, the CNA profile of a tumor sample is usually generated using micro-array or high-throughput sequencing. Regardless of the technology, CNAs data is derived from relative measurement of signal intensity and the data generation processes are prone to noise contamination from several sources. Therefore, the copy number values in a CNA profile usually deviate from the their corresponding DNA levels, and the extent of deviation differs between profiles. This inconsistency poses a great challenge for data integration and comparison in large scale genome analysis. In this study, we present a novel method named Minimum Error Normalization of Copy Numbers (MENCN). For each CNA profile, MENCN first reduces the noise level, then calculate values representing the normal DNA copies (baseline) and the change of one copy (level distance), and finally normalize all values uniformly. Experiments of MENCN on simulated data showed an overall accuracy of 93% and 91% in determining baseline and level distance, respectively. Comparison of baseline and level distance estimation with ABSOLUTE and karyotyping on tumor cell lines NCI-60 produced results of high coherency. Lastly, we applied GISTIC on both the original and normalized CNA data from the Caner Genome Atlas (TCGA). The normalized data showed prominent improvement of both sensitivity and specificity in detecting focal regions. In general, MENCN is useful for CNA data normalization in research involving data of high volume and diverse quality.

These knowledgebases capture evidence describing associations between molecular biomarkers and their role in diagnosis, prognosis, or therapeutic response prediction. Despite their shared purpose, these knowledgebases lack shared standards for the generation, structure, and retrieval of their content. As a result, the analyst is left with a difficult tradeoff: for each knowledgebase left unused there is increased potential for missed findings of clinical significance, but for each knowledgebase used the analyst must understand the nuances particular to that resource and evaluate the evidence accordingly when generating the clinical report. </p> <p>To survey the scope and nature of this tradeoff, we created the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC; cancervariants.org, an international consortium of established clinical interpretation experts dedicated to alleviating the bottleneck in clinical report generation.

Furthermore, the abundance of cell populations can have an association with a covariate that has additional information about the sample, such as treatment group, age, sex, survival time, etc. In differential abundance analysis, the goal is then to find cell populations whose abundance changes according to a covariate.  One approach is to fit linear models to find those relationships. A problem occurs if a covariate is not always completely observed, but instead for some samples only a minimum value is known. This type of missing data mechanism is known as censoring and occurs frequently in the analysis of survival times.</p> <p>The simplest way to deal with censored covariates is to discard all samples containing incomplete data. But for small sample sizes or high censoring rates, this method becomes highly inefficient and might even introduce a bias. Better is therefore to directly take into account the censored nature of a covariate, which can be achieved with a similar setup as when a covariate is missing: multiple imputation. The main difference to classical multiple imputation is the imputation step which uses a censoring specific method.</p> <p>A comprehensive simulation study was performed by testing six different methods under various conditions. One method in particular, called Kaplan-Meier imputation, showed a good performance in terms of detection rates and error control. It detects much more reliably differentially abundant cell populations for small samples sizes with high censoring rates than the case where incomplete samples are discarded.</p>"},{"location":"news/2020/2020-04-16-zh-seminars-in-bioinformatics/","title":"Setting up a pipeline for horizontal gene transfer detection","text":"<ul> <li>12:15 (Skype Call)</li> </ul> <p>Abstract In addition to vertically transferring genes to their descendants, bacteria can horizontally transfer genes to other members in their community.

These signatures are further observed at non-CpG sites, resembling methylation context observed in specialised cell types, including neurons and oocytes.  We further show that these preferences are not mediated by the differential recruitment of the two de novo DNMTs to the genome but are resulting from structural differences in their catalytic domains. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that, in case of DNMT3A, the preference is due to favourable polar interactions between the flexible Arg836 side chain and the guanine that base-pairs with the cytosine following the CpG.

Many countries have faced a shortage of diagnostic kits as well as a lack of infrastructure to perform necessary testing. Due to these limiting factors, only patients showing symptoms indicating infection were subjected to testing, whilst asymptomatic individuals, who are widely believed to be responsible for the fast dispersion of the virus, were largely omitted from the testing. The inability to implement population diagnostic and contact tracing strategies has forced many countries to institute lockdowns with severe economic and social consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) encouraged affected countries to increase testing capabilities to identify new cases, allow for a well-controlled lifting of lockdown measures, and be ready for future outbreaks. Here, we propose HiDRA-seq, a rapidly implementable, high throughput, and scalable solution that uses NGS lab infrastructure and reagents for population SARS-CoV-2 testing. This method is based on the use of indexed oligo-dT primers to generate barcoded cDNA that can be multiplexed from a large number of patient samples. The protocol targets a region of the putative ORF10, which is highly conserved in the different SARS-CoV-2 isolates sequenced to date. Since the targeted region is located near the 3\u2019-end of the genome, HiDRA-seq can capture both the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) as well as all subgenomic RNA transcripts (sgRNA) generated in infected cells.</p> <p>HiDRA-seq entails a viral enrichment, followed by a small amount of short read sequencing data and a basic bioinformatics pipeline for downstream mapping and diagnosis. The small amount of short read sequencing data required allows the multiplexing of hundreds to thousands of patients in one sequencing run and is an affordable reality. Furthermore, HiDRA-seq can be adapted by a wide variety of short read sequencers with diverse outputs across the clinics. The nature of the enrichment step and detection of both gRNA and sgRNA in this protocol offers incredible versatility, as it can be tailored to any other respiratory virus or organism of interest that produces poly-adenylated transcripts. The implementation of such a rapid and versatile approach such as HiDRA-seq would definitely enable a more efficient outbreak management. </p>"},{"location":"news/2020/2020-09-03-zh-seminars-in-bioinformatics/","title":"ReSeq simulates realistic Illumina high-throughput sequencing data","text":"<ul> <li>12:00 in Y-55L-06, UZH Irchel Campus and 12:15 om  ZOOM Call</li> </ul> <p>Abstract In high-throughput sequencing data, performance comparisons between computational tools are essential for making informed decisions in the data processing from raw data to the scientific result.

While point mutations can be pinpointed to a targeted genetic element, copy number variations (CNVs) involve copy number gain or loss of a large DNA segment which often covers hundreds of genetic elements in one event. Although the vast majority of variations are not directly fucntionally cancer promoting, we observe consistency in CNV landscape within the same cancer types and corresponding increase in heterogeneity along with increased distinction in physiology and morphology. This implies that particular CNV may promote cancer type-specific progression. Previously, it was observed that a focal CNV (with length shorter than 3Mb) indicated stronger functional relevance than large-scale CNV. In addition, we observe higher frequency of CNV segment start and end points near known driver genes. Taken together, we designed a statistic that harness properties of collective CNV segments, to delineate the non-random alteration of genes exerted through CNV. Using 9 different cancer types from multiple sources and platforms, we ranked all genes in the genome for their importance based on the CNV data. The same cancer types cluster together by genome-wide significance scores. Known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can be found at the top. We have also compared with GISTIC2.0 using the same data and identified similar regional peaks, but this method can provide significance measure on the gene level.

Even though the burden has decreased due to the deployment of different interventions in recent years, all those gains are threatened by biological threats that largely affect the success of different control strategies. The parasite uses different mechanisms to escape diagnostic tools and drug treatment, challenging one of the key control strategies, based on prompt detection and case management. Sequencing technologies, especially Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) have played a major role in understanding parasite genomic variation including drug resistance, diagnostic resistance, and population structure. However, exploring more advanced technology such as Third generation/long-read sequencing technologies might be worthy in terms of information that can be generated. Both whole genome sequencing and long reads could provide information on the complex genomic region of the parasite compared to short-read sequencing technologies.</p> <p>We propose to develop a whole genome long-read-based assay with Oxford Nanopore (Minion) to explore variations including structural variation. We hypothesize that more information on drug resistance gene, hrp2/3 gene, and parasite diversity will be obtained from this assay and will add value on the usefulness of the MMS on informing the performance of interventions to the NMCPs. We will develop an assay-based Nanopore technology, as it is relatively cheap and easy to implement in malaria-endemic countries.  We also aim to develop a bioinformatics pipeline that will be useful for calling and visualization variants obtained from long-read sequencing data, the pipeline will be useful for all countries implementing MMS. We aim to implement the developed laboratory assay and bioinformatic pipeline on large-scale samples collected through the MSMT project in different regions with varying transmission intensity in Tanzania mainland. Finally, will explore different information that can be mined from short and long reads platforms with a subset of samples with sequenced data generated form MIPs and Illumina, whole genome and Illumina and whole genome and Nanopore. With this dataset will explored on sequence coverage, quality, ability to detect complexity of infection and profiling drug resistance our aim is to assess how these technologies can complement each other in terms information generated and their applicability in MMS. We will develop a long-read assay for variation detection using culture strains with known drug resistance, hrp2/3, and diversity profile; we will explore different methods of DNA extraction, DNA enrichment, and selective Whole Genome Sequence (sWGS), and at each point will assess DNA yield and sequence coverage will also be assessed. A bioinformatic pipeline will be developed for data analysis and making the use of long-read sequence data, this will be done by exploring/evaluating different tools/software and the best-performing ones will be used to develop a full pipeline. The laboratory assay and the bioinformatic pipeline will be implemented in samples collected through the MSMT in 13 regions of Tanzania mainland with different transmission intensities, at the end, short and long reads data will be compared using established and developed bioinformatics pipelines respectively. We will suggest the ideal laboratory assay for sufficient DNA yield required for sequencing and ideally sequencing method to be used in MMS for timely feedback to the NMCP.</p> <p>Novel mutations might be discovered in drug resistance genes such as pfmdr1 and plasmepsin 2/3 and in the pfhrp2/3 gene with the use of developed long read assay and will map their prevalence and distribution in the country.

To address this problem and enable aggregated data analysis at Petabase scale, we developed MetaGraph, a tool for indexing very large collections of sequences in de Bruijn graphs.

Our exact k-mer matching searches at ~400kbp/s on a database of microbial samples, which is almost 4\u00d7 faster than the current state-of-the-art, while our more sensitive per-base-pair alignment achieves ~7kbp/s.

The proposed cycle consistency regularization term is generally applicable to VAE based models, also when other regularization penalties are used simultaneously. In contrast to many other penalties, however, this cycle consistency regularization term provides its regularization effect not via an additional enforcement on the latent space or similar, but rather by naturally incentivizing the model to recognize its generated output during training.

Geometric deep learning using graph representations has emerged as a promising approach to investigate tumor heterogeneity. Still, these approaches suffer from interpretability and transferability limitations <sup>2</sup>. In this work, we propose a geometric deep-learning model with an interpretability framework to predict metadata from spatial datasets. Our approach draws inspiration from concept learning in computer vision, introducing concept graphs as a way of redefining the input space in terms of high-level premises that are relevant to the task at hand [3]. Concept graphs are cell graphs, which are graphical representations of a tissue, typically extracted from an image, where nodes represent cells and edges between nodes denote adjacency between cells. However, concept graphs are constructed only on a subset of all cells, where the filtering that induces a subset is defined by a premise. For example, well-established cancer hallmarks (e.g., tumor-promoting inflammation) can be used as premises to construct concept graphs where only cells that participate in the relevant interactions (e.g., tumor-immune cells) are included. By mixing and matching different premises, our approach offers a novel way of modeling the tumor microenvironment.</p> <p>In summary, our approach decomposes each tumor sample into concept graphs, computes embeddings for each one of them using a concept-specific graph neural network, and finally, integrates all embeddings in a downstream prediction engine with an attention mechanism <sup>3</sup>. This mechanism highlights the relevance of each premise for a given prediction, providing an avenue for interpretation. The novelty of our approach lies in disentangling complex tumor graphs into interpretable concept graphs, allowing us to explore the relevance of inputs in terms of high-level premises instead of low-level features such as pixels or nodes in a graph. We applied our framework to a publicly available breast cancer imaging mass cytometry dataset <sup>4</sup>, achieving highly accurate and interpretable predictions. With spatial omics and multiplexed imaging data becoming increasingly popular, we hope that our approach will offer an interpretable and transferable framework that can assist in identifying cancer-related mechanisms and their relevance for clinical predictions. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Andriy Marusyk, Vanessa Almendro, and Kornelia Polyak. \u201cIntra-tumor heterogeneity: a looking glass for cancer?\u201d In: Nature Reviews Cancer 12.5 (May 2012).

In particular, CRC disproportionately affects African American (AA) patients who have worse clinical outcomes, but the molecular underpinnings are still poorly understood.

Genetic ancestry analyses further revealed distinct germline and microenvironmental features: in particular, rs16906252 was absent in East Asian and African CRC patients and synergistic with pre-diagnosis red meat intake.

Thanks to advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and computational power, microbial communities can now be studied without the need to cultivate them in a laboratory setting. Essential tasks in studying microbial communities include the identification and quantification of their member taxa and the pair-wise compositional comparison of different microbial communities.</p> <p>To this end, typically PCR-amplified fragments of universal taxonomic marker genes are sequenced and quantified to generate taxon abundance tables. These tables can then be analyzed to determine the composition and diversity of, and the differences between microbial communities. By random (shotgun) sequencing of total community DNA samples, it is, although still challenging, possible to reconstruct microbial draft genomes by a series of steps including metagenome assembly and binning. This way, it is possible to access genomic information of organisms that cannot be readily studied under laboratory conditions.

Thanks to advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and computational power, microbial communities can now be studied without the need to cultivate them in a laboratory setting. Essential tasks in studying microbial communities include the identification and quantification of their member taxa and the pair-wise compositional comparison of different microbial communities.</p> <p>To this end, typically PCR-amplified fragments of universal taxonomic marker genes are sequenced and quantified to generate taxon abundance tables. These tables can then be analyzed to determine the composition and diversity of, and the differences between microbial communities. By random (shotgun) sequencing of total community DNA samples, it is, although still challenging, possible to reconstruct microbial draft genomes by a series of steps including metagenome assembly and binning. This way, it is possible to access genomic information of organisms that cannot be readily studied under laboratory conditions. Such approaches have revealed an immense, underexplored taxonomic and gene functional diversity of our microbial world.</p> <p>Lerning objectives:</p> <ul> <li>You can formally describe the composition and diversity of, and the differences between microbial communities</li> <li>You understand the process, value and challenges of reconstructing microbial genomes from metagenomes</li> </ul> <p>You will find material for exercises related to the lecture linked below.</p>"},{"location":"teaching/UZH-BIO390/2022/2022-11-01-Katja-Baerenfaller/","title":"Proteomics","text":""},{"location":"teaching/UZH-BIO390/2022/2022-11-01-Katja-Baerenfaller/#katja-baerenfaller-swiss-institute-of-allergy-and-asthma-research-siaf-and-university-of-zurich","title":"Katja Baerenfaller, Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research (SIAF) and University of Zurich","text":"<p>In proteomics one of the important bioinformatics tasks is to generate lists of reliably identified peptides and proteins in mass spectrometry-based experiments.
