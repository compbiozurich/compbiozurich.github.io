This project is based on the premises that:

* cytogenetic aberration data (e.g. chromosomal translocations) represent an important set of molecular markers, esoecially in hematologic malignancies but also in developmental diseases
* a large body of such data exists, but is mostly difficult to access and or search, systematically
* cytogenetic annotations can be converted into modern variant annotation forrmats, such as being developed by the _Genomic Knowledge Standards_ workstream ([GA4GH::GKS](http://ga4gh-gks.github.io)) of the _Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org))
* an implementation to access genome variant data is the _Beacon_ API

<!--more-->

The project will entail

* identification and retrieval of (molecular-)cytogenetic reference datasets
* developing a cytogenetic => variant objects parsing software (based on some pre-existing code examples)
* implementation/adaptation of a _GA4GH Beacon_ instance (e.g. from our [Beacon+](http://beacon.progenetix.org) resource)

The project can be adjusted to a timeframe between 6-12 months, depending on the host institution's requirement.

Participation in additional projects is possible/probable.
