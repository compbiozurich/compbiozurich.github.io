## Morning

The morning of day 08 will feature a hands-on practical of the bioinformatics 
pipeline discussed on the afternoon of day 07.
The day will start with a brief refresher on the starting point of our pipeline:
files with raw sequencing reads and a reference genome. After this, time will be
spent on generating alignments and variant calls from the provided data, applying several
widely used bioinformatics tools along the way.

## Afternoon

The afternoon will be spent on reflecting on (or finishing) the steps from the practical.
Afterwards, literature and/or slides will be provided to provide more background on Short Tandem
Repeats (STRs); What are they? Why can they be problematic to analyse? Why is their variation
relevant? These questions should prepare you for the morning of day 10, where the outputs of
the bioinformatics pipeline will be analyses and interpreted.
