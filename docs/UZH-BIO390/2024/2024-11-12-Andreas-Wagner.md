#### Andreas Wagner

This part of the course BIO390 (Introduction to Bioinformatics) will review
examples of biological networks their basic properties. 

<!--more-->

## Learning goals for exam preparation 2024:

After this lecture you should be able to

* enumerate various examples of biological networks and their characteristics.  
* apply simple quantifiers of network structure to analyze a network, such as the degree distribution and betweenness centrality.
* distinguish between the structure of biological networks and simple mathematical models of networks, such as the Erdős-Rényi model.
* explain the concept of modularity in networks.
* explain how a simple modularity-detection algorithm works.
* determine whether a network is a small-world network or not
* apply the basic principles of flux balance analysis to very simple metabolic networks.
