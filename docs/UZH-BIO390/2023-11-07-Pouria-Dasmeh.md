#### Pouria Dasmeh

This part of the course BIO390 (Introduction to Bioinformatics) will review
examples of biological networks their basic properties.

## Learning goals for exam preparation:

In the Bio390 course, we explored various examples of biological networks and their characteristics. We specifically examined several online databases, such as STRING, KEGG, and Reactome, that facilitate data retrieval for constructing these networks. Additionally, we delved into the mathematical models of networks and learned about the distinctions between biological networks and random networks (such as the Erdős-Rényi model). An important characteristic we focused on to differentiate between network types was the degree distribution. Moreover, we gained insight into determining the positioning of different nodes within a network using metrics like betweenness centrality. Towards the end, we investigated the robustness of biological networks under different perturbations and briefly overviewed mathematical models that aid in understanding the flow of information through various nodes in a network.
