# BIO390 - Introduction to Bioinformatics

## Summary

The handling and analysis of biological data using computational methods has become an essential part in most areas of biology. In this lecture, students will be introduced to the use of bioinformatics tools and methods in different topics, such as molecular resources and databases, standards and ontologies, sequence and high performance genome analysis, biological networks, molecular dynamics, proteomics, evolutionary biology and gene regulation. Additionally, the use of low level tools (e.g. Programming and scripting languages) and specialized applications will be demonstrated. Another topic will be the visualization of quantitative and qualitative biological data and analysis results.

## Practical Information

### Requirements

The _introduction to Bioinformatics_ is a series of lectures aimed at students w/
a medium to advanced undergrate level in Life Sciences. Participants are expected
to be *knowledgeable in the basic concepts of molecular biology and genetics*, but
also to have some *basic understanding in statistics and concepts of programming*, if
not practical experience (_i.e._ have attended introductory courses, done some data
analyses in R or Python etc.). Experience with common platforms used for shared
code/document management (e.g. Gitlab/Github...) is helpful but not strictly required.

### Schedule & Notes

* Autumn semesters
* 1 x 2h / week
* Tue 08:00-09:45
* UZH Irchel campus, **Y-03G-85**
* [OLAT](https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/17583866272/Infos/0) - but not much there...
* No lecture recordings - we do **not record** the lectures since HS23 (regular
    attendance is expected) _but_ there might be still 2022 [lecture recordings](https://uzh.mediaspace.cast.switch.ch/channel/22HS_BIO390___Introduction-to-Bioinformatics) available
* Course language is English

### Syllabus

Some [learning goals](/UZH-BIO390/learning-goals/) should provide
you with additional guidance - but please be aware that those may include details
which not have been covered in the current semester; still good to know but not
necessarily relevant for the exam.
