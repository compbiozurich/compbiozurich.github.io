#### Ahmad Aghaebrahimian (ZHAW)

Biomedical science is rich in structured and unstructured textual data including but not limited to hundreds of ontologies as well as millions of scientific publications. The semantic web and its stack of standards provide an efficient way for organizing knowledge extracted from such a huge volume of data. Modeling data in knowledge graphs makes complex question answering and reasoning over abundance of information manageable and feasible. In this session, we will find out how.

### Objective of the session:

#### learning about:

* Semantic Web and its benefits
* The stack of standards in the semantic web and their functions
* RDF for modeling data
* OWL/OBO for modeling a biomedical domain
* SNOMED CT/UMLS
* Querying knowledge graphs for answering biomedical questions
