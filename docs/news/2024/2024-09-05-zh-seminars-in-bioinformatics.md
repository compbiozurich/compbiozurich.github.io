**Abstract** Multi-cellular systems orchestrate function through an interplay of
their molecular constituents and structural organization. Recent spatial molecular
imaging (SMI) technologies can profile tissues at molecular resolution while retaining
target coordinates â€” albeit limited in the number of (transcript) targets measurable
thus far. In an immune-oncology context, these data have the potential to characterize
(pre)malignant tissues with molecular precision, thereby laying the ground stones
for personalized medical decisions to be made.

Here, we leveraged 1k-plex SMI data on the human tonsil to develop a computational
pipeline to process these data<!--more-->, and to explore various out-of-the-box analysis approaches.
Independently, we acquired 18k-plex SMI data on colon tissue sections that cover the full range of tumor evolution: from normal epithelia to colorectal cancer (CRC) via premalignant Tubullovillous adenoma (TVA) lesions that can give rise to different CRC subtypes; these data are among the first of their kind world-wide.

In this talk, I will present a multi-faceted view of our results, including: sequencing- and imaging-based data, pathology-guided and unsupervised, as well as established and problem-tailored analysis approaches.
