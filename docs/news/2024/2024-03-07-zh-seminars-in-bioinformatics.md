**Abstract** Many cancer patients benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. However, response rates vary across cancer types and patients and current biomarkers have limited capacity to identify patients who might respond to treatment. To profile the tumor microenvironment (TME) with multiple technologies and potentially identify novel biomarkers the IMMUcan consortium set out in 2019 to profile and analyze the TME from up to 3000 cancer patients until 2026. Tumor samples from every patient undergo bulk RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing, whole-slide multispectral imaging and imaging mass cytometry. We describe our workflow enabling us to reproducibly measure thousands of samples by imaging mass cytometry. We show first results of a retrospective cohort of non-small cell lung cancer where we highlight our approaches for the identification of biomarkers using the imaging technologies and comparisons with the sequencing based data.
