Proteins, along with their activities, modifications, subcellular localisation, and interactions, play a central role in determining the appearance and physiological state of a biological organism. A variety of cellular processes influence protein levels and activity. Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins and the proteome, aiming to understand these dynamic processes in detail. One of the key bioinformatics tasks in proteomics is the generation of reliable lists of identified peptides and proteins from mass spectrometry-based experiments.

After this lecture, you will be able:  

* to recognise and describe the significance of protein characterisation 
* to explain the principle of a mass spectrometry-based experiment
* to apply the principle of de novo peptide spectrum matching
* to describe the principle of database-dependent peptide spectrum matching 
* to calculate the false discovery rate based on a target decoy approach
* to describe various application methods of proteomics
