#### Michael Baudis

This day provides some notes about the submitted notes, introduction to Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis concepts and classification systems used to describe cancer
types and clinical apperances.<!--more-->

Also, I will present the development of the GA4GH "Beacon" protocol for federated
genome discovery.
