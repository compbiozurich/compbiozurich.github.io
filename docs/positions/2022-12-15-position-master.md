# Master's position in Bioinformatics
 
The [URPP Evolution in Action: From Genomes to Ecosystems](https://www.evolution.uzh.ch/en.html) is seeking Masters students for projects in bioinformatics. The URPP Evolution in Action involves multiple research groups in biology, and it 
plays an important integrative role for the diverse biological disciplines at UZH.

We have several projects available at the interface between computation and biology, which aim to gain insight into biological mechanisms by mining data from labs and literature. These projects involve the analysis of multi-omics data, 
including DNA methylation, transcriptome, chromatin modifications, and chromatin accessibility in plants. Some projects also involve software development.

We are looking for candidates with programming experience in `R` and knowledge of `UNIX`-like platforms. Familiarity with git and experience in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data is advantageous, but not necessary. Applicants with 
research experience are particularly encouraged to apply. We welcome applicants from a variety of backgrounds, including biology, bioinformatics, mathematics, computer science, physics, or any relevant interdisciplinary field.

The student will be directly supervised by [Dr. Deepak Tanwar](https://www.evolution.uzh.ch/en/aboutus/bioinformatics.html) and will join a team of bioinformaticians and biologists who work together on the generation and analysis of 
experimental data. Through this position, students will have the opportunity to learn or improve their skills in version-controlled genomic/epigenomic data analysis, writing efficient code, making publication-ready figures, cluster 
computing, scientific writing, and presentation skills.

To apply, please send a CV and cover letter to Deepak Tanwar at [deepak.tanwar@evolution.uzh.ch](mailto:deepak.tanwar@evolution.uzh.ch)
